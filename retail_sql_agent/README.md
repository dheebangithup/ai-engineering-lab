# 📊 SQL Analyst Agent

An AI-powered SQL data analyst agent fully built with the **Claude Agent SDK**.

Ask natural language questions about your data — the agent automatically inspects the database schema, writes SQL queries, executes them, and summarizes the results. Now featuring a **premium real-time dashboard** to visualize the agent's internal reasoning using the native SDK capabilities.

## Features

- 🤖 **Claude Agent SDK** — Uses the native SDK for tool-orchestration and Skills deployment
- ⚡ **Real-time Flow Visualizer** — See "behind-the-scenes" skill activation, tool calls, and executed SQL
- 🌐 **Premium Web UI** — Dark-themed FastAPI dashboard with SSE streaming
- 💬 **Conversation Memory** — SDK-native session resumption via `session_id` (Auto-saves context)
- 🛡️ **Safe by default** — Only `SELECT` queries allowed, dangerous keywords blocked via MCP
- 🗄️ **Multi-database Support** — Connects to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite out of the box (`sqlalchemy`)
- ⚙️ **Configurable** — Model, connection string, tokens all via environment variables

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd retail_sql_agent
uv sync

Create a `.env` file:

```env

```

### 3. Run the Dashboard (Recommended)

```bash
uv run main.py
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
